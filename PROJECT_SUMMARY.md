# Project Summary: Predictive Maintenance MLOps Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a **production-grade, portfolio-ready MLOps implementation** for predictive maintenance using TensorFlow and Azure cloud services. It demonstrates end-to-end machine learning engineering from data preprocessing to production deployment with automated retraining.

## What Was Built

### Core ML Components
1. **Data Pipeline**
   - Synthetic sensor data generation (10,000 samples)
   - Comprehensive preprocessing with missing value handling and outlier removal
   - Advanced feature engineering (rolling stats, interactions, health indicators)
   - Stratified train/test splitting

2. **Model Training**
   - **TensorFlow Implementation**: Deep neural network with 128-64-32 architecture
   - **PyTorch Baseline**: Alternative implementation for comparison
   - Class imbalance handling with weighted loss
   - Early stopping and learning rate scheduling
   - Model versioning and checkpointing

3. **Evaluation & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1)
   - Confusion matrices and performance visualizations
   - Drift detection using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests
   - Automated retraining triggers

4. **Inference Service**
   - Flask REST API with health checks
   - Prometheus metrics integration
   - Single and batch prediction endpoints
   - Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
   - Model metadata and version tracking

### Infrastructure & DevOps
5. **Terraform Infrastructure as Code**
   - Azure ML Workspace
   - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with autoscaling
   - Container Registry (ACR)
   - Storage Account and Blob Storage
   - Key Vault for secrets management
   - Application Insights and Log Analytics
   - Complete with variables, outputs, and provider configs

6. **Azure ML Pipeline**
   - Orchestrated workflow for preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and evaluation
   - Component-based architecture for reusability
   - Automated model registration
   - Triggered retraining based on drift and performance

7. **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
   - Automated testing (pytest with coverage)
   - Code quality checks (Black, Flake8, isort, mypy)
   - Terraform validation (fmt, validate, tflint, tfsec)
   - Docker image building and pushing to ACR
   - Automated deployment to AKS
   - Azure ML pipeline triggering

8. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus configuration for metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboard templates
   - Custom metrics: prediction rate, latency, confidence distribution
   - Service health monitoring
   - Application Insights integration

### Supporting Files
9. **Documentation & Configuration**
   - Comprehensive README with architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
   - Requirements.txt with all dependencies
   - Setup.py for package installation
   - Dockerfile with security best practices
   - .gitignore for clean repo management
   - MIT License

10. **Testing**
    - Unit tests for preprocessing module
    - Pytest fixtures and parameterization
    - Test coverage tracking
    - CI integration for automated testing

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions
- **Multi-framework approach**: TensorFlow (primary) + PyTorch (baseline) demonstrates versatility
